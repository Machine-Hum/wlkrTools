		{diploma in robotics and mechatronics}
		{british columbia institute of technology}
		{this diploma focused on building a solid foundation in electronics, math and physics before moving into higher level classes, such as robotic application, microcontroller theory and sensor theory. my final project was to design and build a delta robot for use in a pick and place application. this project was sponsored by a local robotics company.}
