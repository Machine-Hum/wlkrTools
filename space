12:32:59      machinehum | Has anyone made a decentralised radio telescope array... a system where    
                         | you setup a satellite at your house with a SDR and raspberry pi and join a 
                         | big network to make a huge radio telescope?
12:33:08      machinehum | Or is that crazy talk
12:35:03          darsie | I think you need to record with sub period precision to use it for         
12:40:16        superkuh | machinehum, no. Start trying to achieve coherence by yourself.             
12:41:03        superkuh | But there is satnogs. Many amateurs all combine the singular efforts to    
                         | record and decode satellites then upload the data with metadata to a       
                         | central site.

12:51:23       +petschge | for coherence you need to know separation to within delta x < lambda/12.   
                         | And you need to have timestamps such that delta t * nu < 1/12. Even in L   
                         | band at say 1.4GHz that requires sub nano-second precission in your        
                         | timestamps. There is bootstrapping procedures with suitable calibrator     
                         | sources if you do not have that accuracy, but that still requires that the 
                         | distance and timing jitter stay constant within t                          
12:51:29       +petschge | hose bounds                                                                
12:52:28       +petschge | one of the bigger challanges in Lofar is to distribute a timing signal of  
                         | that quality                                                               
13:00:48     ghostbuster | what is the accuracy of gps time?                                          
13:06:34       +petschge | very good long term stability, but on short time scales it can be off by   
                         | tens of nanoseconds                                                        
13:06:52       +petschge | so it is good to discipline a local osciallator, but is insufficient on    
                         | its own                                                                    
13:08:40     ghostbuster | cool                                                                       
13:12:13          darsie | There are cheap atomic clocks, I think.                                    
13:12:51       +petschge | rack mounted, temperature controlled rubidium oscialators                  
13:30:10      machinehum | Cool                                                                       
13:30:30      machinehum | Right, so timing across a large network would be really hard               
13:30:34      machinehum | Makes sense

13:31:19          darsie | Maybe there are lower frequency radio sources to observe.                  
13:34:01       +petschge | low frequency makes the resolution worse and increases problems due to     
                         | dispersion in the solar wind                                               
13:34:18 Lando-SpacePimp | WillPittenger, remember when USS Voyager went faster than Warp 10 and      
                         | Janeway and Paris turned into lizards and made lizard babies?              
13:34:35       +petschge | so can do 30 Mhz or so, but below that it gets annoying                    
13:44:35       Gnonthgol | I do know a local company that does distributed sensor arrays with local   
                         | oscillators                                                                
13:44:57       Gnonthgol | when they started the clocks were too expensive but they bet the prices    
                         | would go down                                                              
13:45:35  @WillPittenger | Lando-SpacePimp: The Millennium Falcon would be embarrassed by TARDIS.     
13:45:36       Gnonthgol | and now they are able to buy them in bulk of 1000 which would have been    
                         | unheard of ten years ago                                                   
13:46:29       Gnonthgol | they are able to get a few tens of milimeters accuracy for sound           
13:47:45       Gnonthgol | we might see some amateur astronomy project within the next decade or two  
                         | but for now the cost involved to build the infrastructure is too great     
13:47:56       Gnonthgol | even the professionals struggle with radio interferometry                  
13:49:57       +petschge | yes and no. it is routinely done every day at multiple sites, but clock    
                         | problems is still something that takes constant work to keep it running.   
                         | and if you build a new site you will spent month during commissioning      
                         | fighting this issue                                                        
13:55:08       Gnonthgol | there might be certain special observations that might benefit from        
                         | amateur radio astronomers but not interferometry                           
13:55:55       Gnonthgol | I am thinking something similar to the image of the shaddow of the         
                         | asteroid we captured a while back, that used a series of telescopes at     
                         | strategic positions

13:57:55       +petschge | interferometry would be nice to reconstruct 3d tracks of astroids          
13:58:49       +petschge | you might even be able to get that via radio broadbast plus the reflection 
                         | of the ionized trains. in which case you can use the primary broadcast as
