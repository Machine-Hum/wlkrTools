# Niche Area
The reasonable way to go about developing a niche product would be to start with
the market itself, rather than the idea. The key points you want to understand
from this analasys is...
    1) How big in the niche market
        - (guess) Big: Animal owners
        - (guess) Small: Lizard owners
        How to get these numbers without having to guess?
            - Google trends
            - Site visits?

    2) How _new_ is the niche market


potential_buyers = market_size * pec_int;

potential_buyers: How many people will but you thing
market_size: How big is the market
pec_int: What percentage of people are interested

pec_int = market_buyability / pd_capital

market_buyability: Do people buy things in the market??
    - (guess) Soccer: 0.2
    - (guess) Modular Synths: 0.8

pd_capital: How much money is going into product development (overall)

potential_buyers = market_size * (market_buyability / pd_capital);
