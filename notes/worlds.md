# Worlds / Realm.one
The advantage we have over other games is a hardcore networking effect. The MVP
should focus on emphasizing element itself. This means the ability to fork the
game and get started with a server fast.

## MVP (Game itself)
- Attacking
  - When a player does a melee attack, it should show through the sprites that
  look like they're attacking - NPC
  - Monster AI. They should walk around and attack players
- Player HP should be shown using hearts like zelda

The above two points would make a dynamic game. I think adding these two would
be interesting. Should be the next steps.

- Players exp
  - Players skills depend on their levels

## MVP (Interoperability)
- Load player info from blockchain
- Implementing neighboring servers.
